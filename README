1. Briefly discuss how you implemented each functionality: setting up interfaces, setting up default routes, and setting up per-destination routes.

--> As per the instructions, using "ip address add" command, we performed ip assignment on each interface by going on the device. For h1-h4, One ip address each was assigned to the interface going to the router. In the same way, There were 4 interfaces going to different hosts from router, and all of them were given different ip addresses. To forward the packets from Hosts to router, On each host a default route was added via the interface address going to router. Similarly, on Router, corresponding to the interface going to each host, a rule was added in routing table to forward the packet to respective host.

2. Are there known issues or functions that aren't working currently in your attached code? If so, explain.

--> NO KNOWN ISSUES. 

3. What problems did you face developing code for this project?

--> The command line syntax, working on different hosts and VM and to connect them, the transfer of files between hosts.

4. What did you learn by working on this project?

--> I learned about how does the Networking work and how complex the routes and process of the transfer of packets is.
